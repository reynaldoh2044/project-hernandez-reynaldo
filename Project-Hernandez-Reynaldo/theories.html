            <p>Below are some theories about The Simpsons! What do you think? <a href="about.html">Subscribe</a> and join our Discord to
                 let us know!</p>

            <h2>Chief Wiggum is not Ralph's biological dad!</h2>
            <img src="images/wiggumFamily.png" alt="The Wiggum Family Image" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px; height: 400px;">
            <p>This comes as no surprise. Think about it. Ralph Wiggum shows no resemblace to his mother or father who both have
                blue hair. But guess who has black stranded hair? Eddie from the Springfield Police Department! That's right, a fan theory
                 claims that Ralph is the byproduct of an affair between Sally Wiggum and Eddie. A little cynical, but could it be true?
            </p>

            <h2>The entire Simpson family are geniuses! (Not just Lisa)</h2>
            <img src="images/simpsonFamilyTheory.png" alt="The Simpsons Family Images" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px; height: 400px;">
            
            <p>This one comes as no surprise and is more than likely true! Let us explain...</p>
            <h3>Maggie</h3>
            <p>Maggie has saved her families lives from imminent harm on multiple occassions. As a matter of fact, the show's creators go through 
                great efforts to make obvious Maggie is much smarter than other babies her age. Even the recent short clips Disney has made show this. 
                If Maggie is smart enough to think of a way to save a family in peril as a baby, odds are she's a genius!
            </p>

            <h3>Bart</h3>
            <p>Bart has shown on numerous occassions that he not only entreprenurially intelligent, but he is also astute with people. From working 
                with the mob to running Comic Book Guy's comic store, The Android's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop, Bart has shown incredible intelligence. 
                Fans predict he suppresses his intelligence in order to live a happier life after realizing how happy his father is.
            </p>

            <h3>Marge</h3>
            <p>The show has revealed multiple times that Marge Simpson was always one to get good grades, just like Lisa. The difference is 
                that she gave up any educational pursuit to be with Homer who makes her happy.
            </p>

            <h3>Homer</h3>
            <p>In the episode titled "HOMR" we find out Homer is so incompetent because he has a crayon stuck in his brain. He quickly decides to 
                have it removed and we are met with a brand new Homer. One who learns multiple subjects within weeks. As he learned more and more 
                he quickly became depressed, looking at certain things in life in a negative light. He decides to have the crayon inserted back in 
                his brain because he could enjoy life and his friends more being "stupid."
